# bot
A computer bot, _i.e._ engineered for several purposes.

_bot -- is a computer program that operates as an agent for a user or other program or to simulate a human activity. Bots are normally used to automate certain tasks, meaning they can run without specific instructions from humans_.

_Bots are software programs that combine requests, which are typically provided as text, with contextual data, such as geolocation and payment information, to appropriately handle the request and respond_.

_A bot is an automated software application that performs repetitive tasks over a network. It follows specific instructions to imitate human behavior but is faster and more accurate. A bot can also run independently without human intervention. For example, bots can interact with websites, chat with site visitors, or scan through content. While most bots are useful, outside parties design some bots with malicious intent. Organizations secure their systems from malicious bots and use helpful bots for increased operational efficiency_.

Q. How do good bots benefit businesses?

_Good bots help companies scale operations, improve customer engagement, and increase conversion. For example, companies use customer service bots to respond promptly to customer complaints. Citibot uses AWS to develop chatbots. By integrating Amazon Lex and Amazon Kendra, their chatbots reduce call center wait times by up to 90%_.

_Bots benefit businesses in many ways_:

- _Extend operation hours and provide services at any time_
- _Optimize existing resources and reach a wider audience_
- _Free up human employees from tedious, repetitive tasks_
