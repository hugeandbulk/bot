# bot
A computer bot, _i.e._ engineered for several purposes.

**Innocent : Kids**

_bot -- is a computer program that operates as an agent for a user or other program or to simulate a human activity. Bots are normally used to automate certain tasks, meaning they can run without specific instructions from humans_.

_Bots are software programs that combine requests, which are typically provided as text, with contextual data, such as geolocation and payment information, to appropriately handle the request and respond_.

_A bot is an automated software application that performs repetitive tasks over a network. It follows specific instructions to imitate human behavior but is faster and more accurate. A bot can also run independently without human intervention. For example, bots can interact with websites, chat with site visitors, or scan through content. While most bots are useful, outside parties design some bots with malicious intent. Organizations secure their systems from malicious bots and use helpful bots for increased operational efficiency_.

Q. How do good bots benefit businesses?

_Good bots help companies scale operations, improve customer engagement, and increase conversion. For example, companies use customer service bots to respond promptly to customer complaints. Citibot uses AWS to develop chatbots. By integrating Amazon Lex and Amazon Kendra, their chatbots reduce call center wait times by up to 90%_.

_Bots benefit businesses in many ways_:

- _Extend operation hours and provide services at any time_
- _Optimize existing resources and reach a wider audience_
- _Free up human employees from tedious, repetitive tasks_
- _Collect valuable data for analytics and business intelligence_

What are common types of good bots?
Here are some examples of popular good bots used in enterprise applications today. 

Chatbots

Chatbots simulate human conversation with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies. They can respond to queries on behalf of the customer support team. Highly intelligent chatbots like Amazon Alexa can converse naturally with humans. These chatbots are also known as knowledge chatbots. 

Web crawlers

Web crawlers, or spiders, are search engine bots that scan and index webpages on the internet. They help search engines to produce a better search experience by extracting data to understand the structure and relevance of web content. 

Scrapers

Scrapers, or web scraping crawlers, scan and download specific content on the internet. For example, ecommerce businesses use scraper bots to monitor live product prices on different retail platforms. Marketers use scrapers with natural language capabilities to run sentiment analysis on social media feeds. 

Shopping bots

Shopping bots scan product prices on multiple websites to help customers find the best deals. A shopping bot can also send personalized recommendations on instant messenger apps. 

Monitoring bots

Monitoring bots limit your exposure to security incidents by constantly scanning your systems for bugs and malicious software. They alert you to unusual web activity by collecting and analyzing user interaction data and web traffic. Some monitoring bots can also work alongside other bots, such as chatbots, to ensure they perform as intended. 

Transaction bots

Transaction bots ensure payment details are in order before finalizing transactions on ecommerce sites. They check credit card details and personal data accuracy during checkout. These bots are built with highly secure features to protect sensitive financial data. 

How do bots work?

A computer bot follows precise rules and instructions to accomplish its tasks. Once activated, bots can communicate with each other or with humans using standard network communication protocols. They operate continuously to perform programmed tasks with very little human intervention. 

Different types of bots use various technologies to achieve their goals. For example, chatbots use deep learning technologies such as text-to-speech, automatic speech recognition, and natural language processing to simulate human conversation and dialogue. On the other hand, web crawlers send HTTP requests to websites to read the underlying content. An HTTP request is a communication protocol that browsers use to send and receive data.
